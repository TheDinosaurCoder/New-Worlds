Code Notes:

- Make a varable for each block, get the varable to be attact to the class, append the varables to a list containg the blocks.
- Generate the blocks using the varables based on random positons and block.
- Let the player delete the blocks if they click it, remove from the list. 
- And place in the players inventory.
- Check is the mouse is between the block. Use name to index the block in inventory.
